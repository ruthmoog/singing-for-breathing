Asthma+Lung UK research has found a direct correlation between singing and strong lungs. Evidence shows that when breathing from your diaphragm singing will strengthen your lungs and improve lung capacity.

A research project at the Royal Brompton Hospital compared the effects of participation in a singing group, versus a film club and those receiving standard treatment, on those with respiratory disorders. The study showed a significant improvement in physical health among those participating in the singing group. Dr Nicholas Hopkinson, consultant respiratory physicians says:

“There is common ground between singing technique and the kinds of techniques physiotherapists teach people with chronic respiratory problems”.
