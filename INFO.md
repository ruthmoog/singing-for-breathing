Asthma+Lung UK research has found a direct correlation between singing and strong lungs. Evidence shows that when breathing from your diaphragm singing will strengthen your lungs and improve lung capacity.

A research project at the Royal Brompton Hospital compared the effects of participation in a singing group, versus a film club and those receiving standard treatment, on those with respiratory disorders. The study showed a significant improvement in physical health among those participating in the singing group. Dr Nicholas Hopkinson, consultant respiratory physicians says:

“There is common ground between singing technique and the kinds of techniques physiotherapists teach people with chronic respiratory problems”.

            <p>Regular singing sessions were introduced at The Royal London Hospital to help patients with chronic lung disease, thanks to Dr Anna Moore’s fundraising. Initial funding to set up the group was granted by <a href="https://www.bartscharity.org.uk/our-news/singing-sessions-to-improve-patients-lung-health/">Bart's Charity</a>, this was then increased with Anna’s fundraising.</p>
