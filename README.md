# Singing For Breathing

This is the open repo for the Singing for Breathing RLH community group. The site is in progress and is not yet live.

## Info & Fundraising

You can find out more about the group from the crowdfunder: https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/singing-for-breathing 

And I am raising money for us by doing an around the world Dance Marathon in June: https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/dance-ruth-dance

I am volunteering my time to set up a simple website for free, so the group will be more easily discovered.
