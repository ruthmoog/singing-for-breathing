    <h2>What to expect</h2>

    <p><strong><em>Singing for Breathing <abbr>RLH</abbr></em> (Royal London Hospital) is a musical health group for people who want to learn to better manage breathlessness through singing in a friendly local community.</strong></p>

    <h3>What happens in a <em>Singing for Breathing</em> session?</h3>

    <p>Our sessions will help you with breathing exercises and relaxation techniques, and the fun of singing. The sessions are designed to be enjoyable and foster community, as well as to help with your symptoms and breath control.</p>

    <h4>Warm-up</h4>

    <p>The session will start with a warm-up to prepare your body and get you ready to sing. This will probably include:
    <ul>
        <li>gentle physical warm-up</li>
        <li>breathing exercises</li>
        <li>vocal exercises such as call-and-response, exploring rhythm and vocal range</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The breathing exercises will help you to control feelings of breathlessness, develop helpful breathing habits, and coordinate your breath with movement. You will learn to use your diaphragm to breath and make sound, developing a healthy and efficient breathing pattern over time.</p>

    <h4>Music</h4>

    <p>Your singing facilitator will choose songs that are suitable for people with breathlessness or with a lung condition and, that are enjoyable for all. If there's a song you love (or a song you don't want to sing) we take that on-board. In our online sessions, those who want to can come off mute while we take turns to sing each line of a well-known song.</p>

    <p>We sing songs from a variety of styles in a few ways: call-and-response, together as a group, in rounds with the melody starting at different times or, in parts where you can sing harmonies in a comfortable register. The group likes to learn music from many cultures and languages. View our <a href="./songbook.html">songbook</a> for an idea of the songs we usually sing.</p>

    <h3>Is <em>Singing for Breathing</em> right for me?</h3>

    <p>Regular singing as part of a group is good for your general health and wellbeing, and for improving your quality of life if you’re living with a lung condition. You don't need to be a good singer, or an experienced singer to join in. We always say, it's not about the singing - it's about the breathing!</p>

    <p>Our sessions are aimed at those who experience breathlessness, including anyone suffering from <abbr>COPD</abbr> (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), asthma, long-COVID, pulmonary fibrosis, or any other lung-health problem - and is open to anyone living with breathlessness of any cause and, their carers. You do not need a referral to join the group.</p>

    <p>Sessions are led by an <a href="https://www.asthmaandlung.org.uk/">Asthma+Lung UK</a> trained <em>Singing for Breathing</em> facilitator. You have the freedom to join in at your own pace, and sessions are appropriate for seated or standing participation.</p>

    <h2>What we do</h2>

    <quote class="quoteAnna"><div class="quoteMark">“</div>I was aware that lots of people have problems with their breathing that go on for years and years and there's only so much that drugs and inhalers can help with.<br/><cite>—Dr. Anna Moore</cite></quote>

    <p>Singing for Breathing has been running since <time datetime="2017">2017</time> and started at the Royal London Hospital. It was set up by <em>Dr Anna Moore</em>, a respiratory doctor at Barts Health, who recognised the need for a group that could offer therapeutic activity to help with breathlessness management, along with social support on a regular, long-term basis, free of cost for participants.</p>

    <p>The benefits of singing include reducing breathlessness and improving wellbeing. We have a growing evidence-base for the management of breathlessness, particularly in chronic lung disease, and the potential to significantly improve health equity. Singing and breathing exercises is helping patients and, improving the care they’re given.</p>
