<h2>What happens in a Singing for Breathing session?</h2>

Our sessions will help you with breathing exercises and relaxation techniques, and the fun of singing. Our sessions are designed to be enjoyable and foster community, as well as to help with your symptoms, and breath control.

<h4>Warm-up</h4>

The session will start with a warm-up to prepare your body and get you ready to sing. This will probably include:
The first half of the session comprises facilitated exercises designed to train participants to breathe and make sounds using their diaphragm, developing a healthy, efficient breathing pattern. In the second half, the group goes on to sing songs with some preparation from the facilitator, or just spontaneously remembered songs. The group has several favourites that they like to sing together. Participants are encouraged to suggest songs and to teach them to the group and all are enthusiastic about learning music from different cultures as well as sharing their own. It’s important to note that it’s not about the singing – the group is not a choir – it’s about the breathing.

    <li>physical warm-up</li>
    <li>breathing exercises</li>
    <li>vocal exercises such as call-and-response exploring rhythm, and vocal range</li>
</ul>


The breathing exercises will help you to control your feelings of breathlessness, develop helpful breathing habits, and coordinate your breath with movement.

<h4>Songs</h4>

Your singing leader will choose songs that are suitable for people with breathlessness or with a lung condition and, that are enjoyable for the group. If there's a song you love (or a song you don't want to sing) we take that on-board.

We sing songs of a variety of styles in a few ways: call-and-response, together as a group, in rounds with the melody starting at different times or in parts where you can sing in a harmonies in a comfortable register. In our online sessions, those who want to can come off mute to take it in turns to sing each line.

View our <a>songbook</a> to get an idea of the songs we usually sing.

Sessions are one hour long, and are held weekly on Wednesdays at 1pm. The group meets online, with monthly in-person sessions in Stratford E15 (with online access). All our sessions are free to attend.

<h3>Is Singing for Breathing suitable for me?</h3>

Singing for Breathing is aimed at those who experience breathlessness, including anyone suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, long-COVID, or other lung-health problems, and is open to anyone living with breathlessness of any cause, and their carers. You do not need a referral to join the group.

Sessions are led by a British Lung Foundation (now known as Asthma + Lung UK) trained Singing for Breathing facilitator. You have the freedom to join in at your own pace, and sessions are appropriate for seated or standing participation.

Regular singing as part of a group is good for your general health and wellbeing, and for improving your quality of life if you’re living with a lung condition. You don't need to be a good singer, or an experienced singer to join in. We always say, it's not about the singing, it's about the breathing!

<h2>How do we help?</h2>

Singing for Breathing has been running since 2017 and started at the Royal London Hospital. It was set up by Dr Anna Moore, medical lead for the group, and a respiratory doctor at Barts Health who recognised the need for a group that could offer therapeutic activity to help with breathlessness management, along with social support on a regular, long-term basis, free of cost for participants.

Singing for Breathing has a growing evidence base for the management of breathlessness, particularly in chronic lung disease, and the potential to significantly improve health equity.

"I wanted to [start the Singing for Breathing group] because I was aware that lots of people have these problems with their breathing that goes on for years and years and there's only so much that drugs and inhalers can help with."

We are keen to improve accessibility to Singing for Breathing so that anyone who lives with chronic breathlessness can benefit from the physical therapy, social support and joy that singing together brings.

<h3>What our participants say</h3>

"Singing for Breathing has become an integral part of my personal well-being routine."

"The sessions have really helped me focus better on my breathing."

“I can now walk without panting and along with a better diet and loss of weight have reduced my blood pressure to a point where my doctor has taken me off blood pressure medication"

"Since joining the group my asthma has finally come under control, I've stopped snoring and started dance classes, I'm working in the office more often, and I'm using my reliever inhaler less."

"I have kept up a fairly active social life by joining other groups, though singing was the first."

"My overall health has benefited from being able to continue with the running programme."

"It's very good for socialising, and it's a benefit for my lungs".
