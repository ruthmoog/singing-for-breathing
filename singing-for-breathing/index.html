    <section>
        <p>Regular singing as part of a group is good for your general health and wellbeing, and for improving your quality of life if you’re living with a lung condition. You don't need to be a good singer, or an experienced singer to join in. We always say, it's not about the singing; it's about the breathing!</p></section>

    <h2>What we do</h2>

    <h3>What happens in a Singing for Breathing session?</h3>

    <p>Our sessions will help you with breathing exercises and relaxation techniques, and the fun of singing. The sessions are designed to be enjoyable and foster community, as well as to help with your symptoms and breath control.</p>

    <quote class="pullQuote"><div class="quoteMark">“</div>It's very good for socialising, and it's a benefit for my lungs.</quote>

    <h4>Warm-up</h4>

    <p>The session will start with a warm-up to prepare your body and get you ready to sing. This will probably include:
    <ul>
        <li>physical warm-up</li>
        <li>breathing exercises</li>
        <li>vocal exercises such as call-and-response, exploring rhythm and vocal range</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The breathing exercises will help you to control feelings of breathlessness, develop helpful breathing habits, and coordinate your breath with movement. You will learn to use your diaphragm to breath and make sound, developing a healthy and efficient breathing pattern over time.</p>

    <quote class="pullQuote"><div class="quoteMark">“</div>Singing for Breathing has become an integral part of my personal well-being routine.</quote>

    <h4>Music</h4>

    <p>Your singing leader will choose songs that are suitable for people with breathlessness or with a lung condition and, that are enjoyable for all. If there's a song you love (or a song you don't want to sing) we take that on-board. In our online sessions, those who want to can come off mute while we take turns to sing each line of a well-known song.</p>

    <p>We sing songs from a variety of styles in a few ways: call-and-response, together as a group, in rounds with the melody starting at different times or, in parts where you can sing harmonies in a comfortable register. The group likes to learn music from many cultures and languages. View our <a>songbook</a> to get an idea of the songs we usually sing.</p>

    <h3>Will Singing for Breathing be good for me?</h3>

    <p>Our sessions are aimed at those who experience breathlessness, including anyone suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, long-COVID, pulmonary fibromalgia, or any other lung-health problem - and is open to anyone living with breathlessness of any cause, and their carers. You do not need a referral to join the group.</p>

    <quote class="pullQuote"><div class="quoteMark">“</div>I can now walk without panting and along with a better diet and loss of weight have reduced my blood pressure to a point where my doctor has taken me off blood pressure medication</quote>

    <p>Sessions are led by an <a href="https://www.asthmaandlung.org.uk/">Asthma + Lung UK</a> trained Singing for Breathing facilitator. You have the freedom to join in at your own pace, and sessions are appropriate for seated or standing participation.</p>

    <h2>How we help</h2>

    <quote class="pullQuote"><div class="quoteMark">“</div>I was aware that lots of people have problems with their breathing that go on for years and years and there's only so much that drugs and inhalers can help with.<cite>- Dr. Anna Moore</cite></quote>

    <p>Singing for Breathing has been running since 2017 and started at the Royal London Hospital. It was set up by Dr Anna Moore, a respiratory doctor at Barts Health, who recognised the need for a group that could offer therapeutic activity to help with breathlessness management, along with social support on a regular, long-term basis, free of cost for participants.</p>


    <p>We have a growing evidence base for the management of breathlessness, particularly in chronic lung disease, and the potential to significantly improve health equity.</p>
